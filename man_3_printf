.SH SYNOPSIS

 #include "holberton.h"
 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <stdarg.h>
 #include <stdlib.h>
 #include <unistd.h>

 int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION

 _printf() function give a output according to a format. this function
 give a output stdout(standart output stream).

.SH RETURN VALUE

 In a successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding
 the null byte used to end output to strings).

 If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH FORMAT OF THE FORMAT STRING

 The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any.
 The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %)
 which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications,
 each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.Each conversion specification 
 is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.

 One can also specify explicitly which argument is taken, at each place where an argument is required,
 by writing "%m$" instead of '%' and "*m$" instead of '*',where the decimal integer m denotes the 
 position in the argument list of the desired argument, indexed starting from 1. Thus,

 printf("%*d", width, num);
 and
 printf("%2$*1$d", width, num);

.SH THE CONVERSION SPECIFIER

 A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their 
 meanings are:

 c
 the int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

 s
 The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).

 d, i
 The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

 %
 A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
