 which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications,
 each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.Each conversion specification 
 is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.

 A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their 
 meanings are:

 c
 the int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

 s
 The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).
